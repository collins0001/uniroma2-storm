We have extended Storm to provide distributed monitoring, scheduling and management capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Important Note\r\n**The project is not stable yet**\r\nWe want to open our code, and we are refactoring the code and working on the documentation. Please, be patient and wait some few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Short description \r\nWe have extended the Storm architecture to run distributed, adaptive, and QoS-aware scheduling algorithms. The extension introduces some key components on each worker node that enhance the system with adaptation capabilities, relying on a MAPE (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute) feedback loop periodically executed. Specifically, the newly introduced components are: the AdaptiveSchedulers, the QoSMonitors, and the WorkerMonitors.\r\n\r\nThe AdaptiveScheduler implements the following scheduling policies: \r\n- Round Robien\r\n- Pietzuch's algorithm: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1129909\r\n\r\nYou can find further information about our extension of Storm through our papers: \r\n- Distributed QoS-Aware Scheduling in Storm: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2675743.2776766\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
