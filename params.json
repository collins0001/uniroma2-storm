We have extended Storm to provide distributed monitoring, scheduling and management capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. [Short Description](#descr)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"descr\"></a>Short description \r\n\r\nDistributed Storm is an extension of Apache Storm that supports the execution of distributed, adaptive, and QoS-aware scheduling algorithms. It introduces some key components on each worker node that enhance the system with adaptation capabilities, relying on a MAPE (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute) feedback loop periodically executed. Specifically, the newly introduced components are: the AdaptiveSchedulers, the QoSMonitors, and the WorkerMonitors.\r\n\r\n+ *AdaptiveScheduler* is located on each Supervisor and represents the distributed scheduler that executes the distributed\r\nplacement policy;\r\n+ *QoSMonitor* estimates the network latency with respect to the other system nodes and monitors the QoS attributes of the worker node. Currently it monitors the node utilization. The information collected can be used by the AdaptiveScheduler.\r\n+ *WorkerMonitor* is executed for each Storm worker process and computes the data rate exchanged among the application components.The information collected can be used by the AdaptiveScheduler.\r\n\r\nPlease, refer to the [official Storm documentation](http://storm.apache.org/documentation.html) for better understanding the used terminology.\r\n\r\nFurther details on our extension of Storm can be found in:\r\n+ Valeria Cardellini, Vincenzo Grassi, Francesco Lo Presti, and Matteo Nardelli. 2015.
